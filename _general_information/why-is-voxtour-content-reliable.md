**Q:** Why is VoxTour.ai content reliable?

**A:** VoxTour.ai uses a method called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ensure the content is accurate and grounded in real facts. Here's how it works in simple terms:

- The AI searches through a trusted database of verified information about tour destinations.
- It uses this real information to generate the narratives you experience on our platform.

This means our tours are not just created from "thin air" but are based on real, validated sources. You can trust VoxTour.ai to provide engaging and factually correct content without random guesses or "hallucinations."
