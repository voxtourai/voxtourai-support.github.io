## How Local Guides Contribute

Local guides are at the heart of our mission to provide accurate, reliable, and engaging travel content. Here’s what they help us with:

Local guides ensure the POIs listed on VoxTour are accurate and relevant. Their firsthand knowledge helps us provide users with the best recommendations, including hidden gems that only locals know about.

### **2. Creating Customized Routes**
Guides help us design unique routes tailored to different interests and themes, such as history, culture, food, or nature. Their expertise ensures these routes are logical, enjoyable, and packed with meaningful stops.

### **3. Validating Images and Content**
To maintain high-quality visuals on our platform, local guides review and validate images, ensuring they represent the location accurately and beautifully.
