Being connected to the internet ensures that you can interact with the AI seamlessly and access the most up-to-date and accurate information for your tours.

## How does VoxTour create content for its tours?

Our tours feature content generated by state-of-the-art Language Models (LLM). These models utilize advanced natural language processing techniques to provide accurate, informative, and engaging narratives about each tour destination.

## Why is VoxTour content reliable?

VoxTour uses a method called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ensure the content is accurate and grounded in real facts. Here’s how it works in simple terms:

- The AI searches through a trusted database of verified information about tour destinations.
- It uses this real information to generate the narratives you experience on our platform.

This means our tours are not just created from "thin air" but are based on real, validated sources. You can trust VoxTour to provide engaging and factually correct content without random guesses or "hallucinations."
