# API Documentation

## Overview
The VoxTour Partner API enables businesses, tour operators, and content creators to integrate with the VoxTour platform, allowing them to create, manage, and retrieve interactive tour experiences programmatically. With a focus on seamless storytelling, location-based engagement, and AI-enhanced narratives, the API empowers partners to enhance digital tourism solutions.

## What Can You Do with the Partner API?
The VoxTour Partner API is designed to help partners:
- Discover Points of Interest (POIs): Search and filter a vast database of cultural, historical, and modern landmarks.
- Create and Manage Tour Templates: Define structured tour experiences that include multiple POIs, descriptions, and themes.
- Customize Tour Narratives: Tailor storytelling aspects such as tone, complexity, and cultural sensitivity.
- Upload and Manage Media: Enrich tours with images and audio.
- Retrieve Tour Details: Access structured data about tours, locations, and experiences.

## Key Concepts
### 1. Points of Interest (POIs)
POIs represent key locations within a tour, each enriched with metadata such as descriptions, images, geolocation, and historical significance. Partners can search for POIs within a specified area and incorporate them into tours.

### 2. Tour Templates
A tour template serves as the blueprint for a guided experience, defining:
- A title and description that set the theme
- A sequence of POIs
- An estimated duration and distance

### 3. Tours
Once a tour template is created, it can be converted into an actual tour experience tailored to an audience. A tour may include:
- AI-assisted voice narration
- Customizable storytelling controls
- Adjustments for target demographics

### 4. Multimedia Support
VoxTour allows partners to enrich experiences with images and audio. Uploaded media assets can be linked to POIs and tours, providing an immersive experience for users.

## How It Works
### 1. Finding Relevant POIs
Partners can search for POIs using keywords and geographic boundaries, retrieving results that include location details, descriptions, and imagery.

### 2. Creating a Tour Template
A structured tour template is built by selecting POIs, adding descriptions, and defining the storytelling approach.

### 3. Enhancing with Media
Images and audio files can be uploaded and associated with POIs or entire tours, enhancing engagement.

### 4. Launching the Tour
Once finalized, the tour becomes available for users, with AI-powered narration and interactive elements bringing the experience to life.
