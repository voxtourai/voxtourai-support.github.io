# How We Build Narratives at VoxTour

At VoxTour, we believe that every journey tells a story, and every place has a tale worth sharing. To bring these stories to life, we’ve developed a unique, AI-driven approach to creating narratives. Here's how we build them for our two key modes—**VoxExplore** and **VoxRoute**—and why it matters.

## 1. Narratives for VoxExplore: One Stop at a Time

In **VoxExplore**, users can freely discover individual Points of Interest (POIs) nearby. To make these stops more meaningful, we craft single-stop narratives that provide an engaging and insightful experience for each location.

### **How We Do It**
- **Smart Prompts**: We use carefully designed prompts for our AI to generate narratives for each POI.
- **Reliable Sources**: Narratives are based on trusted sources like Wikipedia, official websites, or validated content specific to the location.
- **Context and Clarity**: The narratives are designed to give concise yet rich information, balancing factual accuracy with an engaging storytelling tone.

### **Why It Matters**
- **Authenticity**: Using trusted sources ensures the information is accurate and reliable.
- **Flexibility**: Single-stop narratives allow users to enjoy each POI independently without committing to a predefined journey.
- **Engagement**: By focusing on the uniqueness of each location, we keep users curious and inspired.

## 2. Storyline Planning for VoxRoute: Connecting the Dots

In **VoxRoute**, the experience is all about following a curated journey through multiple POIs. Instead of isolated narratives, we create a **storyline plan** that weaves these stops together into a cohesive and immersive adventure.

### **How We Do It**
- **Theme-Based Planning**: Each route starts with a central theme (e.g., history, art, local legends).
- **Smart Prompts for AI**: We guide our AI to generate narratives for each stop in the context of the overall theme.
- **Connections Between Stops**: The storyline is designed to connect the dots, showing how each location contributes to the bigger picture.

### **Why It Matters**
- **Immersion**: A storyline transforms a series of stops into a meaningful journey.
- **Educational Value**: The connections between locations help users understand the broader context of the route.
- **Memorability**: A well-crafted storyline leaves a lasting impression, making the journey unforgettable.

## Why We Focus on Smart Prompts and Trusted Sources

- **Accuracy**: Travel information needs to be reliable, especially when exploring cultural or historical sites. By sourcing content from trusted references, we ensure our users receive accurate narratives.
- **Quality Storytelling**: AI smart prompts help us create narratives that are not only informative but also engaging and fun to explore.
- **User Trust**: We believe travelers deserve well-researched and meaningful content to enrich their experiences.
